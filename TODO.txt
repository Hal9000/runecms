include directories (.lt3 and .html?)
ignore certain files
all .lt3 files depend on .rb files
search upward for config.txt
handle subdomains sensibly
auto-dependencies
explicit dependencies
detect target leftovers
"cleaning" tasks
non-source dirs going to different path? w/o processing? e.g., mbday_app
